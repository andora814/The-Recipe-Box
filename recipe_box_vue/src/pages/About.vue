  <div>Hi, I'm Doran! I admittedly do not cook, but I created this application for my husband. As a chef, he is often creating new recipes but never writing them down.  After a busy day at work, creating a new recipe does not sound appealing, and we struggle to remember what he has cooked in the past. 

The Recipe Box will allow home cooks and chefs to enter their recipe data and reference them in the future.</div>
