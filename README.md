### ***Description***
####
As a chef, my husband is often creating new recipes but never writing them down. We then struggle to remember what delicious meals we ate in the past, and don't do a great job of planning for the week ahead.

This site will allow home cooks and chefs to enter their recipe data and reference them in the future. An external API will also be used to view others' recipes and add to the user's own personal recipe box. This application will include a Vue frontend, a Postgres database, and a Python Django backend.

### ***Getting Started***

My first step as to create a wire frame, which allowed me to visualize what my app was going to look like. The wireframe helped me to build my component hierarchy diagram and map out which components would need to be created, and how they would all be linked. I then created an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to outline the three models that would necessary in my database. The final step before starting to code was to create a Trello board which details all the steps needed on the front end, back end, and eventually styling.
